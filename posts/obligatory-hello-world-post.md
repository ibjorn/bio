Why this blog? For a while now I needed a place to experiment and break some web development rules.

At the same time this is also my bio to potential clients and business partners.

This isn't about showing off, or bragging, it's **just business**.

I've become quite obsessed with JavaScript web apps and as a web developer, this platform is my place to try out new things and muck about.

This will probably always be a work in progress...
