My career started as a graphic designer with an N1 Art &amp; Design, working at a signwriting company.

In 2003, I discovered my true passion: web development and programming, when I accidentally came across HTML and CSS. Since then, I've been fascinated by the inner workings of the internet and web applications.

During the first part of my career I built themes, plugins, and customised Joomla and WordPress, then ventured into SEO, SEM, and PPC.

One day I came across the development of web apps using GatsbyJS with a headless WordPress implementation. I switched gears and started studying ReactJS and Laravel.

I’m not a pure backend or frontend dev, but since working with React, I feel more biased towards frontend. I started [Black Alsatian](https://www.blackalsatian.co.za 'A Web Development & Digital Marketing Consultancy') in 2003, which focuses on digital marketing and basic websites. I have also worked on numerous long term contracts. Since my partner has taken over managing Black Alsatian I’ve been seeking new and challenging opportunities.
